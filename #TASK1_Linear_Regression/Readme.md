**#Task1**	- Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

**Problem -** What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

**Solution-** Using the dataset provided, train the linear regression machine learning algorithm to predict score when hours is provided 

Use Supervised Learning Algorithm 

Use Linear Regression algorithm which uses labelled data for training and testing

Train the algorithm with given dataset

Test the algorithm and Predict the score if hours is provided


**OUTPUT**

The predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day is 93.69173249.
