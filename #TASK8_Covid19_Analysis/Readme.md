**GRIP Data Science Tasks - The Sparks Foundation**          ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60148115/119185218-5eb1c200-ba2b-11eb-8d46-9d3b410064ed.png)

**#Task5**	- Exploratory Data Analysis - Timeline Covid19_Analysis

**Problem** - Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or any region

**Solution**- With the Covid19 dataset provided,Create a story-telling dashboard 
	            and record the analysis made in each visualizations using tableau


Download Realtime Covid19 Dataset from given link

Use Tableau Desktop for creating realtime visualizations

Based on countries, plot horizontal bar visualizations with number of cases, deaths, geographical representation, total vaccination, gdp & poverty ,cardiovascular death details 

Build a Dashboard with countries as filter and combine the sheets 

Create a story-telling dashboard and record the analysis made in each visualizations 


**OUTPUT**

The number of new cases is higher in Asia and number of new cases per milllion is higher in Montenegro and total cases is higher in Europe

The number of  new deaths is higher in Europe and number of new deaths per million is higher in Hungary and total number of deaths is higher in Europe

Number of people vaccinated is higher in North America, People vaccinated per hundred is higher in Israel, Total number of vaccinations is higher in Asia

Number of people fully vaccinated is higher in North America, People fully vaccinated per hundred is higher in Israel, Total number of vaccinations is higher in Asia

Uzbekistan ranks highest in Cardiovascular death rate

Quatar ranks highest in GDP per capita and Democratic Republic of Congo ranks highest in extreme poverty
