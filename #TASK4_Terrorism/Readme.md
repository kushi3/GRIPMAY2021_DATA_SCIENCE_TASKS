**#Task4**	  - Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism

**Problem**   - As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

**Solution**  - With the Terrorism dataset provided,Create a story-telling dashboard and record the analysis made in each visualizations using tableau

Download Terrorism Dataset (given)

Use Tableau Desktop for creating realtime visualizations

Based on Countries, plot a map with attacktype, targettype and weapontype details 

Based on country, plot horizontal bars visualization of attacktypes 

Based on countries, plot horizontal bars visualization of targettype with subtargettype

Based on countries, plot horizontal bars visualization of weapontype and weaponsubtype

Based on attacktype, plot horizontal bars visualization of attacktype

Based on targettype, plot horizontal bars visualization of targettype

Based on weapontype, plot horizontal bars visualization of weapontype

Build a Dashboard with Countries as filter and combine the sheets 

Create a story-telling dashboard and record the analysis made in each visualizations 

**OUTPUT**

**As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.**

Iraq Country ranks the highest in all kinds of terrorism attacks. It is considered to be the hot zone

**What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?**
